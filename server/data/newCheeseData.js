{"cheese": "Afuega'l Pitu ", "description": "'Afuega\'l Pitu' is one of the oldest Spanish cheeses. It is also famous as one of the most widespread Asturian cheeses.\nThe cheese is produced from cow's full-fat milk in towns that dot the lower basins of river Narcea and river Nal\u00f3n in the central Asturias-Northern Spain. It is made by curdling in a mould at a temperature of between 20 and 25 degrees, for 10 to 48 hours. During its preparation, animal rennet is added and its interior or rind may also be salted.\nThe cheese comes in different types that are recognized by its form/shape, the ingredients added and the ageing period. And hence, each type is known with a particular name. The type that resembles the shape of a bishop's mitre or inverted flowerpot is called 'Troncado/Atronc\u00e1u' (Trunk). If the cheese block is round and resembles a shape of a cloth bag, then it is called 'Trapo/Trapu' (Rag/Cloth). Moreover, if paprika (red chilli or bell pepper powder) is added while making the cheese or the cheese is rolled in paprika taking its red colour, then it is called 'Roxu/Rojo'. This type of Afuega\'L Pitu has very strong, spicy flavour as it is always eaten when matured. It is tasted like a \"tapa\" or dessert, generally accompanied by bread. If the cheese is made without adding paprika, then it remains white in colour, and so, is called as 'Blanco/Blancu'. This variety of Afuega\'L Pitu has soft, white, light, sticky rind which is usually mouldy. In addition to these types, the length for which the cheese has been aged also defines its varieties such as Cured, Semi-cured or Soft.\nThough this cheese is produced all year round, the best type is the one made during spring and winter as the fat content of the milk is at its highest during these seasons!\nAfuega\'l Pitu is eaten either when fresh and slightly aired or once matured after several weeks in a fresh, damp, well-ventilated atmosphere.\nThe name 'Afuega\'l Pitu' is derived from the \"bable\" Asturian dialect. It means 'choking cake' because its unusual texture makes the cheese stick to the taster's palate and pharynx. The name 'Afuega\'l Pitu' also symbolizes one of the Spanish legendary custom \u2018drowning the rooster\' referring to cheese producers feeding a piece of the freshly made cheese to a rooster.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com//media/img/cheese/Variedaes-afuega_JcjOMpm.jpg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//afuegal-pitu/"},

Granted AOC status in 2003, Banon is a very old, traditional cheese said to date back to the Gallo-Roman era.\nThe cheese is wrapped in a case of chestnut leaves, held in place with raffia. Cheese makers gather the leaves in autumn when they fall off the trees. Some of the producers dip the leaves and raffia in vinegar or eau-de-vie to impart a unique flavour to the cheese.\nBanon is aged for a minimum of two weeks. As it ages further, the soft & sticky cheese develops blue and gray moulds on and under the leaves, leading to a strong and intense flavour.  The casing of leaves protects the washed-rind disc and allows the young, slightly acidic cheese to remain moist. It also imparts a fresh vegetable flavour with a hint of wine. Banon cheeses range from firm, mild and lactic to soft, creamy and tart, with a nutty flavour.\nThe local expertise, Fromage Fort du Mont Ventoux, is manufactured by positioning a young Banon cheese (without chestnut leaves) in an earthenware crock, seasoning it with salt and pepper and pouring over vinegar or local eau-de-vie. The crock is often placed in a cool cellar and the cheese left to ferment, with just the sporadic stir. The longer it is left, the stronger it becomes.\nBanon goes well with crusty baguette, fresh fruits and a glass of dry white wine.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com//media/img/cheese/banon3a_1.jpg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//banon/"},

Bleu des Causses produced in winter and summer slightly differ in texture and flavour. Cheeses made in winter are light in colour than their summer equals. The winter produce also tends to be slightly drier.\nA taste of the Bleu des Causses will proffer a blend of rich milkiness amidst the peppery and spicy notes of the blue mould.

The first blue cheese factories were recorded to have started in northern New South Wales and Gippsland in the 1930s and 1940s. At present, more than 22 styles of blue cheese are produced in Australia.\nBlue cheese is called so because the cheese cultures have had the mold Penicillium added at the initial stage of the cheesemaking process. The final product is spotted or veined blue-grey or blue-green molds alongside a natural crusty rind and an earthy appearance. The salty and sharp taste, creamy texture and a pungent aroma tend to be the characteristic feature of blue cheese.\nAustralia produces basic three styles of blue cheese \u2013 Gorgonzola, Danish and Blue Brie.

The final product is characterized by green, grey, blue or black veins or spots of mold throughout the body. These veins are created during the production stage when cheese is 'spiked' with stainless steel rods to let oxygen circulate and encourage the growth of the mold. This process also softens the texture and develops a distinctive blue flavour.\nPDPhoto.orgThe origin of Blue cheese has an interesting story. It is thought to have been invented by accident when a drunken cheese maker left behind a half-eaten loaf of bread in moist cheese caves. When he returned back, he discovered that the mold covering the bread had transformed it into a blue cheese.\nBlue cheese is also identified by a peculiar smell that comes from cultivated bacteria. The flavour of the cheese depends on the type of blue cheese, shape, size, the climate of the curing and the length of ageing. But it generally tends to be sharp and salty. Some of the famous blue cheeses around the world are Roquefort from France, Gorgonzola from Italy and Stilton from England.\nBlue cheese tastes best when served with crackers, pears, raisins, fruit bread and walnuts.

Several hundred years ago, Brie was one of the tributes which had to be paid to the French kings.\nIn France, Brie is very different from the cheese exported to the United States. \"Real\" French Brie is unstabilized and the flavour is complex when the surface turns slightly brown. When the cheese is still pure-white, it is not matured. If the cheese is cut before the maturing process, it will never develop properly. Exported Brie, however, is stabilized and never matures. Stabilized Brie has a much longer shelf life and is not susceptible to bacteriological infections.\nBrie is produced from the whole or semi-skimmed cow's milk. Rennet is added into raw milk and heated to a temperature of 37\u00b0C to obtain the curd.  The cheese is then cast into moulds, several layers of cheese are filled into the mould and then kept for around 18 hours. After this, the cheese is salted and aged for a minimum of four weeks.\nBrie cheese is slightly pale in colour with a greyish tinge under a rind. Its flavour varies depending upon the ingredients added while producing the cheese.\nBrie, one of the great dessert cheeses, comes as either a 1 or 2-kilogram wheel and is packed in a wooden box.

Both these areas are located at the foot of the Picos de Europa Mountains in Asturias.\nThe cheese can be made from unpasteurized cow\'s milk or blended with goat and/or sheep milk. It is aged between two and four months in naturally formed limestone caves. Chilly and humid conditions in the caves facilitate the growth of bluish-green penicillium mould on this highly prized cheese. Unlike other blue cheeses injected with Penicillium, Cabrales cures from the outside of the cheese to the inward.\nA finished Cabrales can be characterized by its strong, penetrating aroma and sharp, acidic, slightly salty taste. It pairs well with red wine, fresh figs, salami, sweet sherry and dry sausages. The cheese is treasured as a base for sauces, for melting over grilled or roasted meats and goes well along with baguette slices, crackers, or fruit.\nEarlier, a traditional Cabrales was sold wrapped in moist leaves of Acer pseudoplatanus. But today regulation requires the cheese be sold in a dark-green-coloured aluminium foil with the stamp of the PDO Queso de Cabrales.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com//media/img/cheese/cabrales.jpg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//cabrales/"},

Some variants are often kept for up to a year to develop a harder texture and stronger taste. Inside the pale ivory rind of the cheese, young Caerphilly has a fresh and pleasant taste alongside a moist yet supple texture. With maturity, the edges become creamy and the flavour becomes more rounded. It usually has a wheel-shape with ivory-white rind dusted with fine flour. As the cheese ages in a moist cellar, the white and gray moulds become thicker and more leathery.

Depending on their age, the flavour, texture and aroma of cheddar cheese can vary.\nCheddar is traditionally creamy white in colour but due to the addition of tasteless food colouring, it often appears dyed in an orange hue. The cheese can be made from raw, pasteurised or thermalized milk to retain more of the flavour-enhancing enzymes. Even if cow\'s milk is the most commonly used source for making the cheese, it is not uncommon to find Canadian cheddar made from sheep or goat's milk. Cheddar ripens from inside out and is classified depending on its ageing time.\nIn Canada, cheddar is produced almost entirely by a number of large companies in Ontario including limited artisanal producers. Of these, the most prize-winning cheddar maker in Canada is the Balderson Cheese Company. The cheese is aged for a minimum of three months and maximum up to six years for optimal supreme quality. Flavoured cheddar cheese spiced up with some popular flavours, made in Canada includes cranberry, dill, flax, garlic, jalapeno, olive and sun-dried tomato. Some of the common types of Canadian Cheddars are Lancashire, Double Gloucester, Wensleydale, Leicester, Derby, Cheshire, Cantal, Caerphilly and Colby.\nMild Cheddar, Medium Cheddar and Marble Cheddar are ideal for snacking and with lighter foods like omelettes, sandwiches and as a garnish.

Vegetable rennet and calcium phosphate is used in the cheese-making process for a better and unique yield.\nBy using a special enzyme to achieve the correct consistency, the dairy produces Caravane, a soft cheese with a white crust. It is made using the bloomy-rind technique. Even though it is very difficult to produce this cheese, the low lactose content has a digestive advantage when preparing various dishes requiring less lactose. The cheese is used in cakes, dips, appetizers, savory meat and various vegetable preparations. Its creamy taste creates an exciting pairing with red wine.\nSince the Mauritanians don\'t eat much cheese, the EU has not implemented regulation policies for dromedary camel products. This has made it difficult to source the cheese in Europe and America. However, with the help of Gary Guthrie, an American importer, the cheese is now available in select New York stores.\nCaravane is a very healthy cheese as it packs in more nutrients, anti-bacterial enzymes, low fat content and vitamins than regular cow\'s, buffalo\'s, sheep\'s or goat\'s cheese.

It is either round or half-cylinder shape with a rind that is engraved with the mark left by the wooden mould. The greyish-dark brown colour of the rind conceals a yellow coloured pate. This cheese comes from the Spanish region of Castile-Leon, which accounts for 85% production of pure sheep's milk cheese. Castigliano best represents the cheese-producing region.\nThe ripening process of Castigliano lasts at least two months to develop a medium mature and mature age cheese. It comes in pieces ranging between a kilo and 3.5kg. The cheese is similar to Manchego but comparatively, it is quite moist and has a few rice-sized holes. Cheeses made with raw milk such as Castigliano have a spicy, cream-caramel, buttery flavour that is perfectly offset by the fresh acidity and hint of salt. The fruity tang of the table cheese when served with the classic Spanish quince or membrilla, takes the dish to a completely new level. Nowadays, a recent variety of cheese produced with a mixture of cows, ewes and goat\'s milk has a somewhat mild flavour. Castigliano cheese goes well with good regional red wines.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com/../media/img/icon-cheese-default.svg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//castigliano/"},

After 10 days of the maturing process, Chabichou contains a minimum 45% fat and comes coated with a thin layer of grey-blue islets.

The cheese is sold at a minimum maturing age of 2 weeks but may be matured for five to six weeks to acquire an intense aroma and flavour.\nUpon ageing, Chabichou develops a characteristic, edible wrinkled rind dotted with occasional grey patches. Cut the cheese and it reveals a firm, creamy \u201cbright white\u201d interior but not before unwinding a thin buttery layer.

This distinctive tang and aroma grow robust and bold as it ages. Milk production of goats, unlike of cow\'s, is seasonal from mid-March through October. Only a few kinds of cheese are aged beyond four months and they cannot be frozen without loss of quality. Considering the availability of limited milk production, experiments are on to make cheeses from frozen goat milk curd.\nThe flavour and aroma of goat cheese rely upon its moisture, density, ageing and flavouring. It can feature a soft, semisoft, firm, or hard texture that indicates its moisture content. They come in many sizes and shapes, such as round patties, log-shapes, drum-shaped, pyramids, round loaves, long loaves etc. Chevres are excellent dessert cheeses, often served as snacks or before dinner drinks.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com//media/img/cheese/Goats_cheese.jpg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//chevre/"},

Produced only a farmstead, milk should come from a herd containing 80% Alpine breed goats. To guarantee the authenticity of the produce and AOC stamp, the diameter of each cheese cylinder must measure 9 to 12cm and a length of 3 to 4.5cm. It should contain 45% fat and weigh between 250 to 350 grams.\nChevrotin des Aravis is a washed rind cheese made similar to a Reblochon, except with goat\'s milk. The maturation which lasts for 3-4 weeks results in a fine and smooth paste and a yellowish-orange rind that is moist and tainted with moulds. As with other chevre cheese, it has the odor of goats and flowers with a nearly sweet taste. Being a mountain cheese, it has an inherited aromatic sourness suggestive of wild herbs fed to the goats.

Fresh curds are white, soft and neutral to taste but they are left to ferment to acquire a bit of tanginess. Soft Durkha or Chhurpi is an excellent source of protein and used as a substitute for vegetables in the mountainous region. A curry and/or pickle are made of Chhurpi and is eaten with rice as a staple food in everyday meals. Chhur singba or Chhur mingba is freshly prepared Chhurpi prepared by adding the extract of crab apple fruits (thung).\nHard Durkha or Chhurpi is made out of yak milk. After the curds are cured at room temperature for 2-3 days, the cheese is sliced and left to dry in the sun or dried in the oven on low heat. This type of Chhurpi becomes very hard and lasts many years. If hard Chhurpi is as old as 4 to 5 years, it is called chhurpupu.

But the commercial productions add an enzyme to speed up the ripening process. This need for acceleration gives the commercial produce a slight change in flavour compared to the artisanal variety.\nSince, Cotija cheese is very salty, strongly flavoured, firm and does not actually melt, it is used for grating on salads, soups, casseroles, tacos, tostadas and chilli. In Mexico, it is also widely used to enhance the flavour of many savoury dishes by mixing directly into the casserole or recipe. In the U.S. it is increasingly popular on pasta.

{"cheese": "Double Gloucester ", "description": "Double Gloucester is a traditional, full fat, hard cheese made from pasteurised or unpasteurised cow's milk. The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester.\nGloucester comes in both single and double varieties. While Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, Double Gloucester uses full fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milking or a mixture of milk and cream. The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky.\nDouble Gloucester participates every year in the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah will perfectly complement a Double Gloucester.\nDouble Gloucester A has won many international awards including Silver medal at 2014 World Cheese Awards.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com//media/img/cheese/Double_Gloucester_OUhl7mX.jpg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//double-gloucester/"},

The solution was Dry Jack, a hard cheese, aged from ten months to upto four years. Firm in texture with a pale yellow pate, the cheese has a rich, nutty yet mild and assertive flavour.

Fermented white cheese marketed under the terms fresh or fresh cheese must contain live flora at the time of sale to the consumer.\" In simple language, Fromage Frais must contain live cultures when sold, whereas with fromage blanc fermentation has been stopped.\nThe cheese in its original form is very bland to taste but also extremely low in fat. Savoury spices, sweet berries and cream are added to improve the flavour which also increases the fat content, sometimes as much as eight per cent.\nFromage Frais is used similar to sour cream or cream by removing the dish off the heat, stirring in the cheese completely and then putting it back on the heat. Mixing in the cheese while the dish is cooking on direct heat can cause it to curdle.\nThe cheese is used as a savoury appetizer or a rich creamy dessert by combining it with herbs, fruits and spices. Fromage Frais with a loose consistency, ranging between heavy cream and sour cream is often employed to thicken and richen sauces. It is a traditional accompaniment to caviar since the milky goodness of the cheese reduces the saltiness of the eggs.\nFresh, creamy cheese like Fromage Frais pairs well with sparkling white wine, Zinfandel and fortified wines.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com/../media/img/icon-cheese-default.svg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//fromage-frais/"},

While Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, Double Gloucester uses full-fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milkings or a mixture of milk and cream. On the other hand, Single Gloucester uses full cream milk from the morning milking and skimmed milk from the evening milking. Single Gloucester has a P.D.O designation, meaning it can be produced only in Gloucestershire. There are only four cheesemakers in Gloucestershire who make Single Gloucester. It is matured for a less amount of time and thus develops a fresh, somewhat nutty taste but slightly more acidic than Double. Also, it is lighter in texture, crumbly and low on fat.The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours.

It is a semi-hard cheese celebrated for its rich, unique flavour and smooth texture. The original cheese markets in Gouda is one of the last standing commercial cheese markets in the Netherlands. Since the name is not protected, it has become a generic classification for all cheeses produced and sold under the name Gouda.\nGouda is typically made from pasteurised cow\'s milk although some artisan varieties use sheep\'s or goat\'s milk to produce cheeses that are going to be aged for a long time. Boerenkaas is a typical variety of unpasteurised Gouda cheese produced by the farmers from the milk of cow's grazing on the natural, low pastures of Netherlands. There are seven different types of Gouda cheese, categorized depending on age. Graskaas is young Gouda ready to be consumed within weeks of production. On the other hand, is the extra aged, Overjarig cheese which has a full-flavoured, hard, golden interior and salty flavour reminiscent of toffee. Between the spectrums is a variety of Dutch Gouda\'s classified as per the texture and age - Jong, Jong belegen, Belegen, Extra belegen, and Oud. Each cheese gets increasingly firmer in texture and richer in flavour than earlier classification. The waxed rind of the cheese also changes by the age as soft, younger Dutch Gouda cheese are identified by yellow, orange, or red wax rinds white mature cheese have black wax coverings.\nStacked Gouda WheelsIn America, smoother and less flavourful commercial Gouda is popular than Dutch Gouda. Artisans in the Netherlands may produce Dutch Gouda using raw milk as well as pasteurised.  To enhance the flavour of the cheese, herbs, seasonings, and nuts may be blended. In the Netherlands, aged Gouda is commonly used to richen soups, sauces.\nYoung Goudas are best paired with beer while medium cheeses taste best when paired with a fruity Riesling or Chenin Blanc. A well-aged Gouda complements wines that are deeply flavoured such as a rich Merlot or Shiraz. Gouda cheese may be grated, sliced, cubed or melted. It may be used as a table cheese or dessert cheese.\nGouda is available in large wheels with each weighing between 10 and 25 pounds.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com//media/img/cheese/GOUDA_SqYJjRh.jpg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//gouda/"},

Moreover, Grana is less crumbly, milder and less complex than its long-aged sibling.\nGrana Padano is manufactured in cylindrical wheels measuring 35 to 45 cm in diameter, and 15 to 18 cm in height.

Named after the village of Idiazabal, the cheese received Spanish D.O. (Denominacion de Origen) in 1987. In summer, the sheep migrate to higher pastures to graze on the blossoming, new grass. During this time, the artisanal cheese makers milk the sheep, make the cheese and leave it in the rafters to mature for a minimum ripening of 2 months. At the end of summer when the cheese makers return back to the lowlands with their sheep, the cheese has ripened and is ready for sale.Idiazabal is produced in the shape of a cylinder, with a smooth and hard natural rind that is pale yellow to amber in colour. The cheese has a compact texture, with a few pinprick holes. It is dry, but not crumbly, and feels pleasantly oily in the mouth. The rind carries the marks of the wooden moulds in which it was drained. The characteristic, smoky flavour is the result of the cheeses having been stored near the fireplaces. There were no chimneys in the simple mountain huts, so the cheeses absorbed the sweet, aromatic smoke. The taste of the cheese is reminiscent of burnt caramel and bacon. It pairs well with red wine and cider.PDO Idiazabal smoked cheese has won a Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It is declared as one of the world's 62 best cheeses.

Once dry, the cheese develops a hard rind on the outside and firm texture on the inside. The cheese has a sweet flavour and the period of ripening is two to three months. It is often used as a topping cheese or relished as a table cheese.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com/../media/img/icon-cheese-default.svg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//oschtjepka/"},

{"cheese": "Pecorino ", "description": "Pecorino is the name given to all Italian cheeses made from sheep's milk. It covers a wide variety of cheeses produced around the country, but specifically, it refers to four main varieties of Pecorino, all of which enjoy PDO protection. These hard ewes\' milk cheeses from central Italy and the island of Sardinia have established a very good export market outside Italy.\nOf these four, Pecorino Romano from Sardinia, Lazio and Tuscan Province of Grosseto is the most widely known outside of Italy. The remaining three mature PDO kinds of cheese are Pecorino Sardo from Sardinia, Pecorino Siciliano from Sicily and Pecorino Toscano from Tuscany.\nPecorinos are traditional, creamery, hard, drum-shaped cheeses. They come in a variety of flavours determined by their age. Aged Pecorinos referred to as \u2018stagionato\' are hard and crumbly in texture with buttery and nutty flavours. Young or \u2018semi-stagionato\' and \u2018fresco\' Pecorinos feature a softer texture with mild, creamy flavours. A good Pecorino will have a smooth, hard rind that is the pale straw to dark brown in colour. The rind will vary in colour, depending on the age of the cheese, and may include a protecting coating of lard or oil. Its compact interior is white to pale yellow in colour, with irregular, small eyes.\nToday, this classic Italian cheese is available in many flavours including Pecorino Pepato spiced with black peppercorns or red chilli. Pecorino is a preferred cheese in many pasta kinds of cheese and an obvious choice in Italian regions where the cheese is produced. Also, it served as a good substitute for the expensive Parmigiano-Reggiano.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com//media/img/cheese/579-pecorino.jpg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//pecorino/"},

{"cheese": "Pecorino Romano ", "description": "Pecorino is a term used to define Italian cheeses made from 100% sheep\'s milk. However, the American counterpart of the cheese is made from cow\'s milk. Of the four Pecorino cheeses that have received Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status under European Union law, Pecorino Romano is one of the most ancient types of cheese as well as the most famous outside of Italy. As per legislation, production of Pecorino Romano is allowed only on the islands of Sardinia, Lazio and in the Tuscan Province of Grosseto. All these varieties differ from each other, depending on how much they have aged.\nAs the name suggests, the history of Pecorino Romano dates back to the Roman times when it was a part of the staple diet of soldiers at war. Roman authors, including Varro, Pliny the Elder, Hippocrates and Columella have mentioned about the cheese & its production technique, in their works. Even today, the cheese is made using only traditional methods in the unique areas of origin. Dry-salted by hand, the wheels get a salting numerous times, to deliver a fabulous taste. Its lengthy aging time from eight to 12 months results in a dry and granular texture and a strong taste. When young, the cheese has a soft and rubbery texture with sweet and aromatic flavour. The flavour becomes sharper and smokier when aged for eight months or longer.\n\nPecorino Romano is one of most widely used, sharper alternatives to Parmesan cheeses. Because of the hard texture and sharp & salty flavour, Pecorino Romano is an excellent grating cheese over pasta dishes, breads and baking casseroles. Although, the use of the cheese is limited because of its extreme saltiness. Pair it with a glass of big, bold Italian red wine or a light beer.\n\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com//media/img/cheese/Pecorino_romano_cheese.jpg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//pecorino-romano/"},

{"cheese": "Red Leicester ", "description": "Red Leicester, formerly known as Leicester or Leicestershire cheese is a traditional hard English cheese made from unpasteurised cow\'s milk. The history of the cheese dates back to the 17th century when farmers recognized the need to make and look their cheeses apart from cheese made in other parts of the country. They decided that the colour of the cheese should denote its richness and creaminess. To set it apart from cheddar and highlight the quality of cheese, Leicester is coloured with a vegetable dye called annatto. The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. The colour indicates that the milk used has a high cream content. Today, only a a couple of farms in Leicestershire makes the cheese using traditional methods and raw milk.\nRed Leicester is a hard cheese, similar to Cheddar but much more moist, crumblier with a milder flavour. It matures faster than cheddar and can be sold as young as two months. A good Leicester cheese can be identified by a firm body and a close, flaky texture. Though the cheese can be consumed young, to reach it's optimum flavour, it should be allowed to mature for six to nine months. A good cheese tastes slightly sweet with an almost caramel flavour and builds up a more robust taste as it ages. The cheese suits a full-bodied white wine such as Muscadet, SancerreChenin Blanc and Vouvray.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com//media/img/cheese/leicester.jpg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//red-leicester/"},

It is yellow in colour with golden rind and is covered with a yellow wax.  This young, gentle and nutty cheese has sweet and sour notes and supple interior.\nThough milder in flavour, it resembles Emmentaler and tastes best when ripen for 3 to 6 months at least.

It is an extremely expensive herb brought to Europe in ancient times from the Middle East. At the last stages of production, Schabziger is molded into distinctive conical shapes and then wrapped in silver foil, ready to be sold.Texturally, the cheese is dry, hard and aged while flavour wise it is pungent, spicy and delicious.

The smoked variant, called \u2018Scamorzi Affumicate\' is made by smoking the cheese over flaming straw for around 10 to 15 minutes. A fresh version of Scamorza is also sold within a few days of production.\nThe texture of Scamorza is elastic, stringy and has less moisture than Mozzarella. In addition, the flavour is more piquant, milky and creamy. Smoked Scamorza has a subtle, smoky flavour with a sweet, light caramel note.\nScamorza is used as a substitute for Mozzarella as it imparts more interest in the recipe. Since Scamorza has excellent melting qualities, it is best known to flavour baking dishes, for griddling or topped with prosciutto for extra zest. The smoky flavour of Scamorza pairs well with oak-aged Chardonnay, Pinot Girgio or Orvieto.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com//media/img/cheese/Scamorza_1.jpg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//scamorza/"},

It was a deliberate attempt to develop the meaty flavour in the cheese as people have to abstain from meat for long periods of time.

But it is equally delicious to eat with fruit, crackers and wine or sprinkled on pasta, rice or soup.The traditional production follows an 800-year old tradition of not using additives and feeding the cows on a special diet containing no silage. Parmigiano Reggiano, an Italian cow's milk cheese would be easily recognized for another reason - the wheel is enormous, approx. 75 pounds. Controlled by Consorzio Parmigiano-Reggiano, a quasi-governmental/trade group, the cheese is aged, a minimum of 18-months to 3 years. It carries a mark on the cheese. Look for the Zanetti mark to ensure you are buying the best. The traditional flavour profile is described as nutty and the long ageing produces white calcium spots which give the cheese a crunchy bite.Parmigiano-Reggiano is used in cooking in various ways. Grate, shred or shave it on pasta, salads, vegetables or fruits. The cheese is high in calcium, and low in fat and hence very healthy.Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is available in two ripening stages.If ripened for 18 months then the taste is sharp and nutty.If ripened for 2 - 3 years then the taste is pure, sharp and nutty.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com//media/img/cheese/Parmigiano_reggiano_piece_1.jpg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//zanetti-parmigiano-reggiano/"},

{"cheese": "Zelu Koloria ", "description": "Zelu Koloria, which translates to \"colour of the sky\" in the Basque language is a raw blue sheep's milk cheese made in the mountainous region of the Pays Basque, bordering France and Spain. The cheese is made between June and November, but sold throughout the year at varying ages, the youngest being 3-months old. This is an unusual treat as blue cheeses are generally not made in this area.It is a semi-hard cheese with uniform blue veins and a dense, mellow-flavoured interior. The natural rind is somewhat dry when the cheese is young, but with age it becomes moist, resulting in an extra tangy richness.  Cheese made in spring is light in taste and texture whilst those from the coming winter season have more strong, intense flavours and heavier texture. The range of flavour varies from sweet butter to lemon zest and peppery. Accompany the cheese with Juracon Moelleux or Port.\n", "image": "https://www.cheese.com/../media/img/icon-cheese-default.svg", "url": "https://www.cheese.com//zelu-koloria/"},
